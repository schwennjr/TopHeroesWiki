# Guild Boss

The guild boss is a regularly occuring event within a guild. The event time is determined by the guild leader and can be set to any time of the day, so regularly check the event page for event times.

The guild boss is a powerful enemy that requires the combined strength of all guild members to defeat. The boss has a large amount of health and require the whole guild to take it down. The guild boss event is a great way for guild members to work together and earn rewards.

    ### Setting up Auto-Rallies
    The normal auto-rally function under the guild's War tab does not automatically add guild members to boss rallies.  Players must use the Auto-Join option on the boss event screen.
	
	It is recommended that you set your strongest queues to auto-join boss rallies.  For example, if you have a total of four queues, you should set your strongest three to auto-rally and manually start rallies with your fourth.
