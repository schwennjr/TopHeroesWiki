# Plundering Carriages

Sending carriages is one of the easiest ways for a player to collect additional resources. In addition to sending a carriage, heroes can plunder other player carriages for additional resources. Each non-mythical carriage can be plundered up to two (2) times. Mythical carriages can be plundered up three (3) times.

    ### Finding a Carriage

    To plunder a carriage, you must first find one. Here are the steps to find a carriage. 
    
    1. Click on the world map icon so you are outside of your castle
    2. Scroll out enough that you don't see castle details, but close enough to see carriage icons
    3. Move around the map between ruins to find carriages
    4. The best carriages to target are Epic (purple), Legendary (yellow), and Mythical (red)
    5. Once you see a carriage, scroll back in to get more details

    ### Plundering the Carriage
    If the carriage is on fire, that means it has been hit once already. 
    However, there may still be a chance to plunder it for good loot. 
    If the cart is being pulled by llamas, not horses and it looks like it is going through a sandstorm, then it is a seasonal carriage. 

    1. Click on the carriage to see more details
    2. Seasonal carts could be from several different servers. If your server has certain rules about your server's carriages, make sure you double check the server number before plundering
    3. Check the players power level to see if it's a level lower than yours
    4. Review the resources you might get if you win the battles. Don't settle for junk rewards
    5. If the plunder level count is less than two, the plunder button will be greyed out. It will also be grey if you hit your max plunders for the day. If not grey, click plunder to start the battle
